# üé¨ IMDb Movie Database SQL Project

This project provides a fully structured SQL schema to simulate an IMDb-style movie database system. It includes table definitions for movies, actors, directors, genres, ratings, and their relationships.

---

## üìå Overview

The goal of this project is to create a normalized relational database structure that models real-world movie data. It is ideal for practicing SQL query writing, understanding database normalization, and building backend systems for movie-related applications.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Schema Features

The database schema includes:

- **Movies**: Title, year, and identifiers
- **Actors & Directors**: Names and IDs
- **Genres**: Film genres associated with each movie
- **Ratings**: Viewer ratings and review counts
- **Relationships**: Movie cast, direction teams, genre mapping
